This project uses data on coal mine locations, electoral outcomes, opinions-based survey panels and general covariates (population structure, educational outcomes, income, energy consumption and sources of energy) to shed light on the relationship between geographic (and thus, social and cultural) proximity to coal-mining and electoral outcomes as well as political opinions.

Datasets used:

1. Global Coal Mine Tracker
